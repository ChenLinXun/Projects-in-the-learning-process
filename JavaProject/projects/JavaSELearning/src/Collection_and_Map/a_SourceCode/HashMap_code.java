/**
 * Hash table based implementation of the <tt>Map</tt> interface.  This
 * implementation provides all of the optional map operations, and permits
 * <tt>null</tt> values and the <tt>null</tt> key.  (The <tt>HashMap</tt>
 * class is roughly equivalent to <tt>Hashtable</tt>, except that it is
 * unsynchronized and permits nulls.)  This class makes no guarantees as to
 * the order of the map; in particular, it does not guarantee that the order
 * will remain constant over time.
 *
 * <p>This implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic
 * operations (<tt>get</tt> and <tt>put</tt>), assuming the hash function
 * disperses the elements properly among the buckets.  Iteration over
 * collection views requires time proportional to the "capacity" of the
 * <tt>HashMap</tt> instance (the number of buckets) plus its size (the number
 * of key-value mappings).  Thus, it's very important not to set the initial
 * capacity too high (or the load factor too low) if iteration performance is
 * important.
 *
 * <p>An instance of <tt>HashMap</tt> has two parameters that affect its
 * performance: <i>initial capacity</i> and <i>load factor</i>.  The
 * <i>capacity</i> is the number of buckets in the hash table, and the initial
 * capacity is simply the capacity at the time the hash table is created.  The
 * <i>load factor</i> is a measure of how full the hash table is allowed to
 * get before its capacity is automatically increased.  When the number of
 * entries in the hash table exceeds the product of the load factor and the
 * current capacity, the hash table is <i>rehashed</i> (that is, internal data
 * structures are rebuilt) so that the hash table has approximately twice the
 * number of buckets.
 *
 * <p>As a general rule, the default load factor (.75) offers a good
 * tradeoff between time and space costs.  Higher values decrease the
 * space overhead but increase the lookup cost (reflected in most of
 * the operations of the <tt>HashMap</tt> class, including
 * <tt>get</tt> and <tt>put</tt>).  The expected number of entries in
 * the map and its load factor should be taken into account when
 * setting its initial capacity, so as to minimize the number of
 * rehash operations.  If the initial capacity is greater than the
 * maximum number of entries divided by the load factor, no rehash
 * operations will ever occur.
 *
 * <p>If many mappings are to be stored in a <tt>HashMap</tt>
 * instance, creating it with a sufficiently large capacity will allow
 * the mappings to be stored more efficiently than letting it perform
 * automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table.  Note that using
 * many keys with the same {@code hashCode()} is a sure way to slow
 * down performance of any hash table. To ameliorate impact, when keys
 * are {@link Comparable}, this class may use comparison order among
 * keys to help break ties.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 * If multiple threads access a hash map concurrently, and at least one of
 * the threads modifies the map structurally, it <i>must</i> be
 * synchronized externally.  (A structural modification is any operation
 * that adds or deletes one or more mappings; merely changing the value
 * associated with a key that an instance already contains is not a
 * structural modification.)  This is typically accomplished by
 * synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map.
 *
 * If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the
 * {@link Collections#synchronizedMap Collections.synchronizedMap}
 * method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
 * unsynchronized access to the map:<pre>
 *   Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap(...));</pre>
 *
 * <p>The iterators returned by all of this class's "collection view methods"
 * are <i>fail-fast</i>: if the map is structurally modified at any time after
 * the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own
 * <tt>remove</tt> method, the iterator will throw a
 * {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
 * modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
 * arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the
 * future.
 *
 * <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 * as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 * throw <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt> on a best-effort basis.
 * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 * exception for its correctness: <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 * should be used only to detect bugs.</i>

     * Implementation notes.
     *
     * This map usually acts as a binned (bucketed) hash table, but
     * when bins get too large, they are transformed into bins of
     * TreeNodes, each structured similarly to those in
     * java.util.TreeMap. Most methods try to use normal bins, but
     * relay to TreeNode methods when applicable (simply by checking
     * instanceof a node).  Bins of TreeNodes may be traversed and
     * used like any others, but additionally support faster lookup
     * when overpopulated. However, since the vast majority of bins in
     * normal use are not overpopulated, checking for existence of
     * tree bins may be delayed in the course of table methods.
     *
     * Tree bins (i.e., bins whose elements are all TreeNodes) are
     * ordered primarily by hashCode, but in the case of ties, if two
     * elements are of the same "class C implements Comparable<C>",
     * type then their compareTo method is used for ordering. (We
     * conservatively check generic types via reflection to validate
     * this -- see method comparableClassFor).  The added complexity
     * of tree bins is worthwhile in providing worst-case O(log n)
     * operations when keys either have distinct hashes or are
     * orderable, Thus, performance degrades gracefully under
     * accidental or malicious usages in which hashCode() methods
     * return values that are poorly distributed, as well as those in
     * which many keys share a hashCode, so long as they are also
     * Comparable. (If neither of these apply, we may waste about a
     * factor of two in time and space compared to taking no
     * precautions. But the only known cases stem from poor user
     * programming practices that are already so slow that this makes
     * little difference.)
     *
     * Because TreeNodes are about twice the size of regular nodes, we
     * use them only when bins contain enough nodes to warrant use
     * (see TREEIFY_THRESHOLD). And when they become too small (due to
     * removal or resizing) they are converted back to plain bins.  In
     * usages with well-distributed user hashCodes, tree bins are
     * rarely used.  Ideally, under random hashCodes, the frequency of
     * nodes in bins follows a Poisson distribution
     * (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) with a
     * parameter of about 0.5 on average for the default resizing
     * threshold of 0.75, although with a large variance because of
     * resizing granularity. Ignoring variance, the expected
     * occurrences of list size k are (exp(-0.5) * pow(0.5, k) /
     * factorial(k)). The first values are:
     *
     * 0:    0.60653066
     * 1:    0.30326533
     * 2:    0.07581633
     * 3:    0.01263606
     * 4:    0.00157952
     * 5:    0.00015795
     * 6:    0.00001316
     * 7:    0.00000094
     * 8:    0.00000006
     * more: less than 1 in ten million
     *
     * The root of a tree bin is normally its first node.  However,
     * sometimes (currently only upon Iterator.remove), the root might
     * be elsewhere, but can be recovered following parent links
     * (method TreeNode.root()).
     *
     * All applicable internal methods accept a hash code as an
     * argument (as normally supplied from a public method), allowing
     * them to call each other without recomputing user hashCodes.
     * Most internal methods also accept a "tab" argument, that is
     * normally the current table, but may be a new or old one when
     * resizing or converting.
     *
     * When bin lists are treeified, split, or untreeified, we keep
     * them in the same relative access/traversal order (i.e., field
     * Node.next) to better preserve locality, and to slightly
     * simplify handling of splits and traversals that invoke
     * iterator.remove. When using comparators on insertion, to keep a
     * total ordering (or as close as is required here) across
     * rebalancings, we compare classes and identityHashCodes as
     * tie-breakers.
     *
     * The use and transitions among plain vs tree modes is
     * complicated by the existence of subclass LinkedHashMap. See
     * below for hook methods defined to be invoked upon insertion,
     * removal and access that allow LinkedHashMap internals to
     * otherwise remain independent of these mechanics. (This also
     * requires that a map instance be passed to some utility methods
     * that may create new nodes.)
     *
     * The concurrent-programming-like SSA-based coding style helps
     * avoid aliasing errors amid all of the twisty pointer operations.

           Node节点实现Map.Entry接口的意义：
           HashMap的元素是封装在Node节点中的，而HashMap类没有对外提供
           获取一个元素或者说获取Node节点的方法，只有一个根据key值返回value值的get(Object)方法
           而且也没有遍历元素的迭代器，因为HashMap并没有实现Iterable接口
           那么当希望遍历HashMap元素，并且拿到该元素的key或value时怎么办？
           于是Node节点实现Map.Entry接口的意义体现了：
           Node节点实现Map.Entry接口中的getKey() 和 getValue() 方法，可以返回节点的key值和value值
           那这两个方法是定义在内部类Node中的，HashMap对象要怎么使用这两个方法？
           于是HashMap中设计了用于方便遍历的内部类集合EntrySet，这个集合中存放的元素是Node节点的引用，
           而且EntrySet集合实现了迭代器，可以通过iterator()方法获得迭代器对象，
           迭代器对象就能返回遍历的EntrySet元素Entry，而其实Entry只是一个接口引用，它实际指向的就是Node
           所以迭代器对象返回的就是HashMap对象中Node节点(元素)的引用，
           通过这个引用就能使用getKey() 和 getValue() 方法，返回节点的key值和value值
           同样的道理：
           HashMap还设计了同样用于方便遍历的内部类集合KeySet和Values ：
           KeySet存放的元素是Node节点键key的引用，它也有迭代器用于遍历HashMap的键key
           Values存放的元素是Node节点键值value的引用，它也有迭代器用于遍历HashMap的键值value

              如果他们的hashCode值一样那么经过同样的运算，出来的hash值也一样，那么计算出他们在
              哈希表中的索引位置也一样，所以hashCode值相同必定发生哈希碰撞。
              除了这样的极端情况，两个对象即使hashCode值不同，通过哈希函数也可能得出相同的索引值，

            // 或者在不为空的情况下内容相同（注意此处的equals方法是否是该键key的类型重写过的）

            /*
              稍做解释：

              如果不满足条件一，也就是说两个元素的key的hash值不同，
              说明两个元素一定不是重复的元素，因为相同的hashCode值通过同样的运算
              得出的hash必定相同，所以两个hash值不同，则他们的hashCode值必定不同，那就不是重复元素

              为什么已经确定了两个元素的索引相同了，他们的hash值仍有可能不同（仍可能不满足条件一）：
              因为有可能他们不同的hashCode值通过hash()方法算出的hash值不同，但是在进行
              (n - 1) & hash 运算时，得出的索引值相同了，发生了碰撞

              如果满足条件一，也就是说两个元素的key的hash值相同，
              未必就能证明两者是重复的元素，因为不同的hashCode值通过同样的运算
              所得的hash值是可能相同的，这跟hash()方法有关

              那么应该进行条件二的判断，
              条件二里，如果两个对象用==运算符比较地址相同，则证明他们就是同一个对象，发生重复；
              如果两个对象确实是地址不同的两个对象，但又发生了哈希碰撞，那么应该比较他们的内容是否相同，
              也就是调用他们的equals()方法判断，如果他们的equals()方法重写了，则是根据设计者
              的逻辑来判断他们是否在逻辑上是重复的，如果他们的equals()方法没有重写，则还是调用Object类的
              equals()方法，用==判断两者的地址（这两个对象是指元素的key对象）。
              因此以下说明特别重要：

              一般重写了equals()，就要重写hashCode()方法：
              在equals()注释说明里是这样说的：
              “通常来说，我们应该保证等价的对象，他们的hashCode值相同，这是hashCode()方法的一般约定。”
              也就是说：
              原本的equals()方法是根据对象地址判断两个对象是否等价，hashCode()方法也是根据对象地址
              计算出的hashCode值，两个方法的判定逻辑是一致的，地址不同的对象，他们的hashCode值不同。
              当重写了equals()方法，说明改变了判断两个非空对象是否等价的判断逻辑（不再比较地址），
              那么应该重写hashCode()方法，保证等价的对象拥有相同的hashCode值，以维护hashCode方法约定。

              这对于Hash集合的元素来说是必须要遵守的，以HashMap为例：
              当两个键key的equals()为true的元素，会因为他们调用默认的hashCode()方法，导致
              他们的hashCode值不同，在不发生哈希碰撞情况下，所在的索引位置不同，都加入到HashMap中，
              导致出现严重的逻辑错误：在HashMap中出现了两个逻辑上重复的元素

              同时也发现，不等价的对象应该尽可能地使他们的hashCode值不同，这有利于哈希表的效率，
              减少哈希碰撞的发生
